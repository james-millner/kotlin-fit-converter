//  A data class representing the entire FIT file. This is an opinionated view on interesting data points and is subject to change.
//  It's an effort to collate as much valuable data from as many activity types as possible. Initially though this has scope for cycling and running primarily.
//  @param activityName The name of the activity.
//  @param activityStartDateTime The start date and time of the activity.
//  @param sport The sport of the activity.
//  @param averageHR Average HR of the activity.
//  @param maxHR Max HR of the activity.
//  @param averageCadence Average cadence of the activity.
//  @param averagePower Average power of the activity.
//  @param maxPower Max power of the activity.
//  @param averageCalories Average calories of the activity.
//  @param averageSpeed Average speed of the activity.
//  @param maxSpeed Max speed of the activity.
//  @param averageTemperature Average temperature of the activity.
//  @param totalAscent Total ascent of the activity.
//  @param totalDescent Total descent of the activity.
